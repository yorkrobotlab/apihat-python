# apihat-python

This repository contains the Python code for the basic core functions of the YRL028: APIHAT robotics extension for the Raspberry Pi (3B+). 

The code includes a Dash (Plotly) server with DAQ control components allowing interactive control of the robot through a web-browser (on port 8082).
